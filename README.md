# lilypad

lilypad is an LLM prompt engine designed around functional pipelines and musically inspired patterns to allow for easy LLM orchestration and context flow management.

In an effort to truly prove its capabilities, the library is coded through ChatGPT prompting itself. The eventual goal is to be able to have lilypad generate itself.
